# AtmosIntel – Hyper‑Local AQI Intelligence Platform

## Overview
**AtmosIntel** is a hyper‑local air quality intelligence system designed to convert sparse monitoring station data into **ward‑level pollution insights**. The platform uses spatial interpolation and environmental analytics to generate **real‑time pollution heatmaps**, identify high‑risk zones, and produce automated advisories for citizens and government authorities.

The goal is to enable **data‑driven urban pollution management** by transforming raw air quality data into actionable intelligence.

---

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Urban air quality monitoring relies on a **limited number of monitoring stations**, which often represent large geographic regions. This creates blind spots where localized pollution sources remain undetected.

For example:

- Delhi has **~47 monitoring stations**
- But contains **250+ administrative wards**

Because of this limitation, authorities struggle to:

- Detect **localized pollution hotspots**
- Identify **pollution sources early**
- Issue **hyper-local health advisories**
- Deploy **mitigation resources efficiently**

This results in **reactive pollution management instead of proactive environmental control**. 

---

# 💡 Proposed Solution

AtmosIntel addresses this problem by generating a **continuous air‑quality surface across the city** using spatial interpolation techniques.

The system pipeline works as follows: 

1. Collect **real-time AQI measurements** from monitoring stations  
2. Use **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation** to estimate pollution levels at unsampled locations  
3. Optimize spatial queries using **KDTree nearest-neighbor search**  
4. Generate a **city-wide pollution surface**
5. Aggregate pollution values at the **administrative ward level**
6. Detect **high-risk pollution zones**
7. Generate **automated citizen advisories and mitigation recommendations**
8. Display results on an **interactive geospatial dashboard**

---

# 🧠 Core Technical Idea

### Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)

IDW is a spatial interpolation technique that estimates pollution levels at unknown locations by **weighting nearby monitoring stations inversely to their distance**.

Points closer to a monitoring station influence the prediction more than distant stations.

Mathematically:
AQI(x) = Σ (AQI_i / d_i^p) / Σ (1 / d_i^p)

Where:

- `AQI_i` = AQI value of station i  
- `d_i` = distance to station i  
- `p` = power parameter controlling influence decay  

---

### KDTree Optimization

Spatial interpolation requires frequent **nearest-neighbor searches**.

Using **KDTree spatial indexing** from SciPy significantly improves performance by reducing search complexity from:
O(n²) → approximately O(n log n)

This enables **fast interpolation across hundreds of ward locations**.

# ✨ Key Features
